<h2>About great ideas and simple usage</h2>
<p>The project named "OnlineTVRecorder.com" enables its users to record TV shows from many stations, even simultaneously. It's like a VCR, but better, bigger and cheaper. The only thing you have to pay is the bill for your internet connection to download the recorded shows.</p>
<p>There are some programs which provide you an EPG and can make sure you don't miss any TV show you want to see. You also have an easy overview over the TV stations you like and their program. Most of those EPG programs also support automatic recording of shows, typically via a TV card.</p>
<p>Crazysoft OTR Remote connects the two technologies described on the top. With OTR Remote, you can use your TV guide program to record your favourite TV shows via OnlineTVRecorder.com. OTR Remote is very easy to use and has a modern and user-friendly interface. The program works on a plugin base, so that experienced users can write their own plugins if a TV guide program is not supported or they want to use OTR Remote in a special way.</p>
