<h2>For frustrating moments</h2>
<p>We have compiled some commonly asked questions and answers to prevent 
 frustration and help you having fun with our product.</p>
<h2>Control Panel</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">My EPG  
 program is not supported!!!</p>
<p>This is not a question...</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Why is my EPG program not supported?</p>
<p>Crazysoft has developed plugins for the (at least in German areas) mostly 
 used EPG programs. If you have decent programming skills, feel free to 
 develop your own plugin using the included sample plugin code. Otherwise, 
 contact us on our <a href="http://www.crazysoft.net.ms/" target=_blank>homepage</a> 
 or discuss your proposal on the <a href="http://www.otrforum.com/showthread.php?t=16919" 
 target=_blank>OTR forums</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Why is my EPG plugin not selectable?</p>
<p>While starting up, OTR Remote logs all plugin loading processes into 
 a text file. You can open it by typing <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">&quot;%TMP%\OTR_Plugins.log&quot;</span> 
 into your Explorer's address bar. If your EPG program's plugin doesn't 
 load, you'll get an explanation here.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Why are my EPG plugin's settings not saved?</p>
<p>Starting from Version 2.0, all settings are saved automatically. In 
 earlier versions this caused confusions, because although the chosen settings 
 were applied, they didn't show up after restarting OTR Remote.</p>
<h2>Add/Remove Recordings</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Why is only one recording job added, although 
 I checked &quot;Also record following show&quot; in the Preferences dialog?</p>
<p>OTR Remote adds 5 minutes to the end time of the show you want to record, 
 forcing OTR to also record the following show. This effect gets visible 
 after the show was recorded and it's available for download.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Why do I get an error when trying to remove 
 a recording I added recently?</p>
<p><span>OTR needs some time to assign manual recordings to its own EPG. 
 You should wait a few minutes before trying to delete a recording.</span></p>
